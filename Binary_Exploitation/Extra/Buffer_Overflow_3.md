# CTF Challenge: Buffer_Overflow_3

## Table of Content

- commands-executed:   checksec --file=vuln
- flag :


### Chain of thought / Learning:
- Okay so guessing by the name of the challenge its a buffer overflow exploit.
- on downloading the files and analyzing using **checksec --file=vuln** command we see that the function has canary protection.
- what is a canary? it is a protection mech against buffer overflow exploits and the way it works is it places a heap of memory between the return address and the buffer memory, when we perform a buffer exploit what we do is write till the return address to get the flag. When canary is enabled it is also overwritten the program performs a basic check that whether the canary is re written or wnot, if it is it crashes.
- so to handle this challenge there are 2 things i need to take care of finding out what is the canary(locally i can create a canary.txt and place my choice of string in it to do the overflow)
- second i need to actually do the overflow exploit.
- so locally i perform the buffer overflow first by creating a canary.txt and providing random input here its flag.
- analyzing the code, there are 2 specific variables i m focused on the canary variable and the buffer itself
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>

#define BUFSIZE 64
#define FLAGSIZE 64
#define CANARY_SIZE 4

void win() {
  char buf[FLAGSIZE];
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,FLAGSIZE,f); // size bound read
  puts(buf);
  fflush(stdout);
}

char global_canary[CANARY_SIZE];
void read_canary() {
  FILE *f = fopen("canary.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'canary.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging canary.\n");
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(0);
  }

  fread(global_canary,sizeof(char),CANARY_SIZE,f);
  fclose(f);
}

void vuln(){
   char canary[CANARY_SIZE];
   char buf[BUFSIZE];
   char length[BUFSIZE];
   int count;
   int x = 0;
   memcpy(canary,global_canary,CANARY_SIZE);
   printf("How Many Bytes will You Write Into the Buffer?\n> ");
   while (x<BUFSIZE) {
      read(0,length+x,1);
      if (length[x]=='\n') break;
      x++;
   }
   sscanf(length,"%d",&count);

   printf("Input> ");
   read(0,buf,count);

   if (memcmp(canary,global_canary,CANARY_SIZE)) {
      printf("***** Stack Smashing Detected ***** : Canary Value Corrupt!\n"); // crash immediately
      fflush(stdout);
      exit(0);
   }
   printf("Ok... Now Where's the Flag?\n");
   fflush(stdout);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  
  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  read_canary();
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```

- on analyzing with ghidra to find the diff in offset of these variables
