### Chain of thought / Learning:

- okay so on researching i dound the function checksec to see the permission of the file.
- checksec: it checks the permission of the file
```console
┌──(anonymous㉿Anonymous)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ checksec --file=vuln
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY FortifiedFortifiable     FILE
Partial RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   78 Symbols        No    0       2vuln

```
- The No eXecute or the NX bit (also known as Data Execution Prevention or DEP) marks certain areas of the program as not executable, meaning that stored input or data cannot be executed as code. (what i found)
- PIE stands for Position Independent Executable, which means that every time you run the file it gets loaded into a different memory address. This means you cannot hardcode values such as function addresses and gadget locations without finding out where they are.
- Here PIE is disabled 
#### Output:
```console

```
