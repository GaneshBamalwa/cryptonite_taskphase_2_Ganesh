### Chain of thought / Learning:
- again i need to reverse engineer the encryption program.
- okay so i reversed every operation in my opinion.
```python
cipher = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"


lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"
dec = "" 
prev = 0
cur =0 
# a character of cipher text =lookup2[x] so char  = lookup2[x]
# x = lookup2.index(char)
# t = (cur - prev) % 40
# dividend = remainder + (div * quo)
z = input()
for x in cipher: 
    cur = lookup2.index(x)
    t= lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
    dec += t
    prev = lookup1.index(t)
print(dec)
```
- the output of this is :
```
 #asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1

```
- okay so i was stuck here for quite some time till i ask blackbox.ai what does this program do and i found out that this is a self input python2 program
- so i asked blackbox.ai to change it to python 3
- and i got the python 3 script and ran but it didnt work.
- so i can install py2 on my linux system and use it there
