## Table of Content

- commands-executed:  
- flag : picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}


### Chain of thought / Learning:
- okay we have a website that when i try to login shows me the sql query it invokes.
![sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5465f281-f733-40a0-8ecb-afe0510b64ff)

-Okay so if with someway i can give it an or condition that has to satisfy say 1=1 it will trip and i ll get the flag
```
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='admin'
```
-so i can add a single quote in the name field and close it off add my condition OR 1=1 and comment out the rest with --. 
- name : ' OR 1=1 --
- password : admin
- and voila i m in. 
![sql1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8160b42-365c-4f1e-ba3b-4678cf92033c)
- we just view the source code and have our flag. 
#### Output:
```console
picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}
