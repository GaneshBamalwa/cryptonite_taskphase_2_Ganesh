# CTF Challenge: Forbidden_Paths

## Table of Content

- commands-executed:  -
- flag :picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}


### Chain of thought / Learning:
- The prolem clearly states that the website is filtering absolute paths , so I have to try reading using relative paths.
- ('.') is current direcotry , ('..') is parent directory
- / is the directory which has flag.txt file but I currently am at /usr/share/nginx/html/ which allows me to read the three text files on the website
- so what I need to do is go to / using relative paths ../../../../flag.txt is how it should be written , i enter it in the input box and hit read
- boom I have the flag.
